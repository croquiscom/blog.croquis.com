Our team had a booth at Korea’s biggest start up-tech conference, beLaunch. We had a great time introducing our new Chrome Extension and reaching out to new/existing users.

<div>&lt;Our Fearless Leader and CEO, Johnny (in Green), with the booth team&gt; </div>

<div>Our beautiful booth drew a lot of attention, and we made sure to walk around with the giant balloon to attract visitors (or balloon lovers). We were able to pitch Biscuit and the new Chrome Extension to well over 700 people! </div>

<div>Johnny is a busy man, but his love for our products knows no bounds. Thus, he was on the battlefront pitching to anyone that would listen and being the face of Biscuit.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Inspired by Johnny, our booth team worked tirelessly. We were standing and talking for more than 20 hours over two days. Biscuit and our Chrome Extension were drawing so much attention there was very little down time. Johnny promises to personally give us all foot massages.  </div>

<div><span>&lt;Johnny talks serious business with an investor; check out the game face&gt;</span></div>

<div><span>&lt;The people love Biscuit. Let Biscuit take control of your vocab learning! &gt;</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>During beLaunch we met an extremely awesome Biscuit user named Joseph. He was so excited by our new Chrome extension that he asked to join our Booth Team and help us pitch, and boy, did Joseph pitch his heart out for hours:</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>“They aren’t even paying me, but I love Biscuit so much so please let me tell you about how Biscuit can change your relationship with your dictionary</span>”</div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Biscuit love pouring out of Joseph’s heart was amazing; thank you Joseph. And thank you to the rest of the Croquis Team and all our visitors/users who met us at beLaunch! </span></div>

<div><span>&lt;Love at first sight; Biscuit and Joseph meet in person for the first time!&gt; </span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe beLAUNCH is a great sign of the times to come for the startup world in Korea. There were some very prominent </span><a href="http://belaunch.com/speaker/">speakers</a><span> with strong interest in Korea such as Eric Migicovsky, founder of Pebble, and David Lee, founder of SV Angel. We were also able to snap photos of:  </span></div>

<div>Just a few weeks after beLaunch the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/25/kakao-daum/">Kakao / Daum merger</a>, forming a $3 billion USD company, and Sequoia’s investment in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/05/28/sequoia-backs-coupang-koreas-answer-to-amazon-with-100-million/">Coupang</a>, valuing the company over $1 billion USD, really caught the attention of Silicon Valley and the global business world. Korea’s startups are really starting to show the world that Korea can be more than just its traditional conglomerates.  <br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We here at Croquis aren’t necessarily chasing the billion dollar valuations, but everyday we are striving to build products that will show the world that South Korea also has some great entrepreneurial minds. </div>
