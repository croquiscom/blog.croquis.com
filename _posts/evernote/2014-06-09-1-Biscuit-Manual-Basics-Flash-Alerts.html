<div>This post will explain Biscuit’s flashcard alert functionality that is very useful for studying words throughout the day without having to constantly open the app. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Flash Alerts are flashcard notifications that are sent from Biscuit even when the app is not running. The flashcards are pulled from your most recently used box(the one on screen when you close the app). The flashcards are selected at random for the notifications.  </div>

<div>You will need to set the time period during which you would like to receive your Flash Alerts using the Start and Stop selectors. You can also set how many flashcards you want to receive(1 to 30) during this time period using the Flashcards selector. You can also choose to only receive marked flashcards within the box as Flash Alerts by using the Marked flashcards only button(see the Flashcard Gestures post to learn how to mark flashcards). </div>
